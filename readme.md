# Mew Exporter

This tool exports your thoughts from [Mew](https://mew.fun/) to store them locally.

It is still in development, and documentation will be polished later.

## Usage

Example:

```bash
python3 mew_exporter.py 15900001234 myFavPassw0rd
```

After that, you will get a whole folder named `export-mew` storing all your thoughts in Markdown files.
